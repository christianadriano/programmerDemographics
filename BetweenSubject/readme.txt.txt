We selected four worker attributes: years of program-ming experience (YoE), profession, score in the qualification test,
 and proportion of IDK answers. In order to have a fair basis to compare workers with each other,
 we computed correlations and differences by considering only the outcome of the first HIT of each worker 
(i.e., first three questions).
