YoE = years of programming experience of workes recruited through Mechanical Turk on July 2015.

The self-reported number of years of programming experience (YoE) was also consistent with professions and test scores.
Professional developers were on average significantly more experienced than the other workers (Wilcoxon test, w = 611628, 
p-value <0.0001). Meanwhile, students were the least experienced and showed the smallest distribution spread (check figure 
in excel file YoE_Profession_Distribution.xlsx). 

Regarding the test scores, workers who passed the test reported 7.8 YoE, while workers who did not pass reported 3.7 YoE. 
This difference was statistically significant (Wilcoxon test, w= 477222, p-value <0.0001). It is also worth noting that 
the YoE for professional developers and graduate students are similar to the ones reported in recent research that discusses
 the use of students in software engineering experiments [91]
